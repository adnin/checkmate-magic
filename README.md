### 2. In-Game Loop

A typical run goes through this loop:

1. **Spawn in the Arena**
   - You appear on a **tile-based battlefield** (chess-like grid).
   - Basic **movement** and **attack** are available immediately.

2. **Waves of Enemies**
   - Enemies spawn in **waves**.
   - Each wave gets progressively harder:
     - More enemies
     - New enemy types
     - Stronger stats / new attack patterns

3. **Combat & Abilities**
   - Move to dodge hits and reposition.
   - Use normal attacks + **special abilities** (inspired by chess pieces).
   - Element tiles (Fire / Ice / Lightning / Nature / etc.) can affect the battle:
     - Fire tiles: damage over time
     - Ice tiles: slow or freeze
     - Others: buffs / debuffs / control effects

4. **Rewards After Waves**
   - When you clear a wave, you get **rewards**, such as:
     - **Cards** (new abilities / modifiers)
     - **Weapons / Armor / Passives**
     - **Currency** for upgrades

5. **Card / Upgrade Phase**
   - Between waves, you can:
     - **Attach cards** to weapons or armor
     - Choose between **multiple upgrade options**
     - Plan synergies for your **next waves**

6. **Repeat the Loop**
   - `Wave → Rewards → Upgrade → Next Wave`
   - Difficulty ramps up over time.
